This is the repository for the Food Interactions with Drugs Evidence Ontology (FIDEO), developped as part of the ANR funded MIAM project.

Main file with the ontology:
- fideo_1.0.O.owl

This repository contains several other folders:
- documentation - information about the ontology and the design decisions behind it
- imports - directory with imports from external ontologies that are too large to be entirely imported
